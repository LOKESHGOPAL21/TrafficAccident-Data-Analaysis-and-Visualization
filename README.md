# Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The objective is to gain insights into accident hotspots and contributing factors, and to visualize these patterns for better understanding and actionable insights.

# Key Features:

#Accident Data Analysis: 
Study accident occurrences based on road conditions, weather factors, and time.<br>

# Hotspot Identification:
Locate and visualize high-density accident zones (hotspots).<br>
# Contributing Factors:
Analyze the impact of road and weather conditions, along with the time of day, on accident severity.<br>

# Visualization: 
Use interactive maps and charts to display accident hotspots and contributing factors.
